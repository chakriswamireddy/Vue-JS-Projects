# Description 

I developed the Therapists page utilizing Vue Router for smooth navigation. Integrated the React-Calendar package. Implemented conditional rendering for dynamic component display and incorporated an external API to fetch and exhibit relevant data, resulting in a comprehensive and user-centric page.
